This means that I can help businesses to verify their Google My Business listing instantaneously.\nAfter being in the program for 2 months and 2 days now, I like to look back to see how I have experienced it and how I have been able to help businesses throughout the world\u0026hellip;\nMy experience with the program The interface through https://partnerdash.google.com/mybusinessprovider works OK, but is missing a few features, which in my opinion could give a better experience to the My Business Provider:\n The interface does what it needs to do: allow me to generate tokens for business owners, which I can send to them, to enable them to finally claim their Google My Business listing. It works fast: a token is generated within the blink of an eye and a list of verification tokens is able for downloading within a matter of seconds after uploading. The verification process for business owners seems to be simple and comprehensible, because I never receive any questions about it. From the perspective from the business owner it also works fast: they are able to claim a listing normally within 1-2 minutes. I am currently set up as a My Business Provider for Africa. In the interface I see all the tokens, generated for businesses throughout Africa by myself AND also by all other My Business Providers! As a result of this, I have to search for my own tokens in a long list, each time I want to check the status of my generated tokens. It would be a lot better, if I only saw my own tokens. I\u0026rsquo;d love to receive an automated email message, when a business I have sent a verification token to, successfully claims its\u0026rsquo; listing. This would allow me to easily tick this off from one of my own ToDo-lists, without having to go back to the interface, search the listing and see whether or not it has been claimed already.  Questions? If you have any questions or want more information on how Google My Business can help you with your business, feel free to contact me.\n","date":1583661600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583661600,"objectID":"204420b3c528c9b52b4e20d4056d71df","permalink":"https://eduarddeboer.github.io/post/google-my-business-provider-my-first-2-months/","publishdate":"2020-03-08T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/google-my-business-provider-my-first-2-months/","section":"post","summary":"I am now a Google My Business Provider for 2 months and 2 days.

I have developed numerous client\u0026rsquo; websites, themes, modified existing plugins and also experimented with developing my own plugins. Once issue that always required a lot of work and ongoing attention, was the performance of each site. Then I discovered the world of static website generators\u0026hellip;\nThe World Wide Web actually started being 100% static. The first version of HTML, as developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, only contained 18 tags and was served as static files from a webserver, without requiring a database. Later databases became a needed resource as customer demands and requirements increased and HTML and website development evolved into dynamic, interactive environments.\nGreat (Open Source) Content Management Systems (CMS\u0026rsquo;es), such as WordPress and Drupal came into existence and were happily embraced by the whole world. Imagine that nowadays, WordPress is powering over 35% of all websites around the world!\nAdmitted, using an off-the-shelf theme to create your own WordPress website is not much more than a few mouse clicks. This makes these popular CMS\u0026rsquo;es an obvious choice for many people and organizations who need a website.\nFunnily enough, many of those sites are pretty static from a visitor\u0026rsquo;s perspective and when you look at them from that angle, they would not require the whole overhead of a CMS with a database.\nThen I discovered static website generators\u0026hellip;\nWhat is a static website generator? As the name suggests, a static website generator\u0026hellip; well\u0026hellip; generates a static website! This means that the content and other data shown in the site, is not being served from a webserver that is running for example the PHP-based WordPress or Drupal to fetch all the content the content and layout from a database, but as simple pre-generated files.\nBecause all the overhead is removed, this results in a much faster website:\nI decided to jump in to discover more about the possibilities. After a brief research I choose for HUGO, downloaded it for my MacBook Pro together with a free HUGO theme, called \u0026ldquo;Academic\u0026rdquo;. And instead of hosting it with my standard hosting provider, I moved it to Amazon S3 to see how well it all could perform.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re currently viewing the results of my first attempts in the world of static websites.\nAs you can see in the image above, the homepage loads in less than 300 ms. As far as I can tell, that is pretty impressive and great from a user perspective!\nAdvantages of a static website A static website has a lot of advantages. Let\u0026rsquo;s cover the most obvious:\n FASTER – because you are only hosting and serving static files. More secure – after all, there is no processing or database involved in the backend, so what is there to hack? Lower cost for hosting – hosting a static website can be done fairly cheap and even for free. Easier to scale – Although I am not hosting this site for a long time at the moment, I think the cost of hosting this website on Amazon is less than € 0,10 per month, whereas the performance will not suffer, even when the website will be hammered.  Of course you miss some of the advantages of dynamic websites with their related CMS\u0026rsquo;es. A CMS is:\n More flexible – with regards to installing plugins and other code to extend the functionality Easier to update content – e.g. out-of-the-box WordPress comes with a great editor (Gutenberg) which looks familiar to anyone who knows a word processor. This makes it very easy to publish new content.  Conclusion I don\u0026rsquo;t know where this experiment will be leading me. I\u0026rsquo;ll keep you posted\u0026hellip;\n","date":1581897600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1581897600,"objectID":"cc78342210c485ed21aa74f79932b839","permalink":"https://eduarddeboer.github.io/post/20200219-how-can-your-website-be-so-fast/","publishdate":"2020-02-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/20200219-how-can-your-website-be-so-fast/","section":"post","summary":"I am currently experimenting with both simplifying my website development and hosting, while increasing the performance at the same time.","tags":["HUGO","Performance"],"title":"How can your website be so fast?","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":" ","date":1580560568,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580560568,"objectID":"dc3725ab9909e43ecae7d621afad43b4","permalink":"https://eduarddeboer.github.io/project/senegambia-beach-hotel/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T13:36:08+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/senegambia-beach-hotel/","section":"project","summary":"Virtual tour of Senegambia Beach Hotel in Gambia on Google Street View","tags":[],"title":"Senegambia Beach Hotel - Gambia","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I became a Google My Business Trusted Verifier back in 2018.
